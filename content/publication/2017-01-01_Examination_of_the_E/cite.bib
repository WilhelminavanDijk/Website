  abstract = {We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to establish the evidence base for using visual activity schedules (VAS) with individuals with intellectual disability. Literature published after 2005 was evaluated for quality using the criteria developed by Horner et al.; a total of 14 studies were included as acceptable. Findings suggest that VAS is an evidencebased practice for teaching a variety of daily living, navigation, vocational, recreation, and academic skills to adolescents and adults with intellectual disability. Results also show increases in independence and on-task behaviors. We conclude the article by discussing limitations and recommendations for future research.},
