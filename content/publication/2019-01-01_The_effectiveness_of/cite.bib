  abstract = {Background: This meta-analysis focused on the teaching of skills to individuals with intellectual disability (ID) to maximise independence increase the likelihood of full participation in all aspects of life, economic self-sufficiency, and independent living. Visual activity schedules (VAS) is an intervention with a growing evidence base that focuses on developing independence.Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of VAS effects on independence skills of individuals with ID. Thirteen single-case design studies met the meta-analytic inclusion criteria, including evidence of a functional relationship via visual analysis. For each graph, three effect size metrics were calculated. The overall effect sizes were calculated with a random effect models and potential influence of moderators with meta-analytic regression models.Results: Results suggest that VAS has a meaningful impact on increasing independent skills for individuals with ID with type of instruction the only moderator.Conclusions: The results suggest all modes of VAS are likely to yield positive effects across age groups, settings, and skills.},
